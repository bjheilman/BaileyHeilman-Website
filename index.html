        <div class="subheading mb-5">History Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Bailey Heilman is currently attending the University of California, Riverside, studying History. She is a Chancellor's scholar, and is involved in the school’s literary magazine as a Poetry Editor. In high school, she was very involved with the music program––participating in Wind Ensemble, Marching Band, and Full Orchestra. She even worked to form United Sound (a program that helps Special Education students learn how to play instruments). In addition to the music program, she also participated in Model United Nations for two years, all while maintaining a 4.6 GPA. During this time, she also worked at Jamba Juice and Taco Bell, managing two jobs on top of academics. 
 <br><br>

       Currently, she works at Starbucks at Glen Mor Market, demonstrating an ability to manage tasks. Her soft skills include clear communication, listening, conflict resolution, positive attitude, and a sense of humor! She works everyday to make not only her work environment, but also her academic environment enjoyable. She believes that no matter how horrible a job seems, the people can always save it. She has worked extensively in food service––a job that is often demanding both physically and mentally––and she knows that there is nothing a positive attitude can’t fix. It can be difficult to stay positive, but the entire experience is much less enjoyable when projecting negativity. Not only does your bad mood affect yourself, but also others, making the shift miserable for everyone. She has worked to maintain a positive attitude even on the worst days, because she understands that unhappiness in the workplace is infectious, but also that the opposite is true. If one person is positive, then everyone else is more likely to be positive––and that ensures that the work gets done, and done well.<br><br>

        This summer, she will be working at the kitchen for a summer camp, but she is currently looking for a position in the fall when she returns to University of California, Riverside. Some of her hard skills include coffee-brewing, latte-making, folding burritos, taking orders, and restocking. Though these skills are applicable to certain jobs, they also lend themselves to soft skills that would be advantageous in any work place, such as the ability to remain calm, keep employees motivated, and keep things orderly and organized. She hopes that this position and the responsibilities that it entails will only further help her in building up my knowledge of food service, as well as help her to build her leadership skills. All work, no matter how menial, gives one the opportunity to further expand upon their experience.
